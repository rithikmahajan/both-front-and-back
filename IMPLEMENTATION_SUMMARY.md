### **Technical Notes:**

1. **Excel Processing:** Currently shows sample data - you'll need to integrate a library like SheetJS (xlsx) for actual Excel parsing.

2. **Data Persistence:** All data is stored in component state - you'll need to integrate with your backend API for persistence.

3. **Validation:** Basic validation is in place - you may want to add more comprehensive validation for production use.

4. **Performance:** All handlers use `useCallback` for optimal React performance.
