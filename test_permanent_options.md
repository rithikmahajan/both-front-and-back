# Permanent Options Feature Implementation

## Features Implemented:

### Step 1: "Make this a permanent option" Button
- Added red button next to Yes/No buttons for custom options
- Button only appears for custom (user-created) options
- Button disappears once option is made permanent

### Step 2: Confirmation Modal
- Modal asks "Are you sure you want to add this as permanent option"
- Two buttons: "yes" (black) and "Cancel" (gray)
- Matches Figma design exactly

### Step 3: Success Modal
- Shows green checkmark icon
- Message: "option added successfully!"
- "Done" button to close
- Matches Figma design exactly

### CRUD Operations:
1. **Create**: Add custom options and make them permanent
2. **Read**: Load permanent options from localStorage on component mount
3. **Update**: Options maintain their permanent status across sessions
4. **Delete**: Remove permanent options with "Remove" button

### Technical Details:
- Uses localStorage for persistence
